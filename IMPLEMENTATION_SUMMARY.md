# Project Overhaul Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of all changes made to enhance the UX, admin workflows, and overall functionality of the Next.js and Supabase club management application.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **CORRECTION: Flexible Hour Input** ✓
**Problem:** The flexible hour input (11-99) was incorrectly implemented in the user-facing `SubmitHoursTab.tsx`.

**Solution:**
- **Removed** all flexible hour input logic from `components/profile-tabs/SubmitHoursTab.tsx` (user tab)
- **Implemented** the correct flexible hour input in `components/admin/RecordHoursTab.tsx` (admin review form)
- Admins can now select 1-10 hours from a dropdown, or select "More..." to input custom hours (11-99)
- Added smooth animations and validation for the custom input field
- The awarded hours are properly validated and submitted when approving requests

**Files Modified:**
- `components/profile-tabs/SubmitHoursTab.tsx` - Simplified (removed flexible input)
- `components/admin/RecordHoursTab.tsx` - Enhanced (added flexible input with validation)

---

### 2. **NEW FEATURE: Pre-Event Reports Tab** ✓
**Purpose:** Allow HR committee members to manage pre-event reports required by the university.

**Implementation:**
- Created **`components/admin/PreEventReportsTab.tsx`**
- Displays all upcoming events (where `start_time` is in the future)
- Each event shows:
  - Title, date, time, and location
  - Status badge (Submitted vs. Needs Report)
  - "Days until event" countdown
  - Button to open university form (opens in new tab)
  - "Mark as Submitted" button
- Smooth animations with `framer-motion`
- Progress summary showing how many events need reports
- Integrated into profile page with `'hr'` permission group (accessible to all HR members)

**Files Created:**
- `components/admin/PreEventReportsTab.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/(main)/profile/page.tsx` - Added new tab for HR committee

**⚠️ DATABASE REQUIREMENT:**
```sql
-- Add this column to the events table:
ALTER TABLE events 
ADD COLUMN is_pre_report_submitted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

---

### 3. **NEW FEATURE: Post-Event Checklist** ✓
**Purpose:** Help HR committee track post-event administrative tasks.

**Implementation:**
- Modified **`components/admin/ReportsTab.tsx`**
- Added new section "Post-Event Tasks" (`مهام ما بعد الفعالية`) in `EventDetailsView`
- Displays after report information for completed events
- Interactive checkboxes for:
  - **"Generate Attendance Certificates"** (`إصدار شهادات الحضور`)
  - **"Prepare Absence Excuses"** (`تجهيز أعذار الغياب`)
- State is persistent - saved to database
- Visual feedback with green highlighting when completed
- Progress bar showing overall completion percentage
- Smooth animations on check/uncheck

**Files Modified:**
- `components/admin/ReportsTab.tsx` - Added checklist section with database persistence

**⚠️ DATABASE REQUIREMENT:**
```sql
-- Add these columns to the event_reports table:
ALTER TABLE event_reports 
ADD COLUMN certificates_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN excuses_prepared BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

---

### 4. **NEW FEATURE: Manual Hour Addition for Admins** ✓
**Purpose:** Allow HR admins/leads to manually award hours to any user.

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced **`components/admin/RecordHoursTab.tsx`**
- Added prominent "Add Manual Hours" button at the top of the tab
- Opens a professional dialog/modal with:
  - **User search** (by name or student ID with live search)
  - Search results display with selection
  - Hours input field (1-99)
  - Description/reason textarea (required)
  - Validation before submission
- Automatically creates an approved entry in `extra_hours_requests` with:
  - `activity_title`: "ساعات مضافة يدوياً"
  - `status`: "approved"
  - `reviewed_by`: Current admin user
  - `notes`: "تمت الإضافة يدوياً من قبل إدارة الموارد البشرية"
- Success toast with user name and hours
- Form resets and data refreshes after submission

**Files Modified:**
- `components/admin/RecordHoursTab.tsx` - Added manual hour addition dialog and logic

**Note:** No database changes required - uses existing `extra_hours_requests` table structure.

---

## 📊 Database Schema Changes Required

Before the new features work correctly, you **must** execute the following SQL commands in your Supabase SQL editor:

### 1. Pre-Event Reports Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE events 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_pre_report_submitted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### 2. Post-Event Checklist Columns
```sql
ALTER TABLE event_reports 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS certificates_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS excuses_prepared BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### 3. Verify Changes
```sql
-- Check events table
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'events' AND column_name = 'is_pre_report_submitted';

-- Check event_reports table
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'event_reports' 
AND column_name IN ('certificates_generated', 'excuses_prepared');
```

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

All components have been tested and optimized for mobile viewports:
- Responsive grid layouts (1 column on mobile, 2-3 on desktop)
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min-height: 44px)
- Horizontal scrolling tabs where appropriate
- Collapsible accordions for space efficiency
- Stack layouts on small screens (flex-col sm:flex-row)
- Truncated text with tooltips on hover
- Optimized font sizes (base 16px to prevent iOS auto-zoom)

## 🔐 Permission Structure

The new tabs follow the existing permission model:

| Tab | Permission Group | Access |
|-----|------------------|--------|
| Pre-Event Reports | `hr` | All HR committee members (member, deputy, lead) |
| Submit Report Link | `hr` | All HR committee members |
| Reports (Main) | `hr_lead_only` | HR deputy and lead only |
| Record Hours | `hr` | All HR committee members |
| Manual Hour Addition | `hr` | All HR committee members (via RecordHoursTab) |
